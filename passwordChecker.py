Project: Password Checker
Class: MGT3850: Data Transformation
Author: Divya Pateliya
Submission: May 21st, 2025

Business Problem:
    Threats of hackers stealing confidential data are becoming increasingly more likely, especially as cyberattacks grow in frequency
    and scale of complexity. One of the most common vulnerabilities exploited in these attacks is the use of weak or previously 
    compromised passwords. The goal of this Python script is to ensure users can test their passwords in a safe environment without 
    risking confidential data, while getting guidance on how to build a strong password. It also checks if a password has appeared in 
    any known data breaches using the 'Have I Been Pwned' API, a public and anonymous service for breach detection.
    
    
Main Functionality:
    1. Password Strength Analyzer
    2. Determine how many times your password has appeared in breaches
